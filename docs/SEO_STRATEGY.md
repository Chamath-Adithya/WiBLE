# SEO Strategy for WiBLE

Ranking #1 on Google requires more than just good code. You need **Authority**. This guide tells you exactly how to build it.

## 1. The "Backlink" Strategy
Google trusts websites that other trusted websites link to. You need to get WiBLE listed on high-authority domains.

### Action Items:
- [ ] **Submit to Awesome-ESP32**: This is the #1 directory for ESP32 projects. Make a PR to [awesome-esp32](https://github.com/agucova/awesome-esp32) to add WiBLE.
- [ ] **Submit to Arduino Library List**: Ensure your library is indexed by the official Arduino Library Manager (we optimized `library.properties` for this).
- [ ] **Post on Hackaday.io**: Create a project page for WiBLE. Write a short article about "Solving the ESP32 Provisioning Problem".
- [ ] **Post on Instructables**: Create a tutorial "How to Securely Connect ESP32 to WiFi using BLE". Link back to your repo.

## 2. The "Content" Strategy
Google ranks content that answers questions.

### Action Items:
- [ ] **Write a Medium/Dev.to Article**: Title it "Why I built the most secure ESP32 provisioning library". Explain the technical challenges of ECDH on ESP32.
- [ ] **YouTube Tutorial**: Record a 2-minute video showing how fast the provisioning is. Title it "ESP32 WiFi Provisioning in 10 Seconds". Link the repo in the description.

## 3. The "Social" Strategy
Social signals (shares, likes) validate your content.

### Action Items:
- [ ] **Reddit**: Post to r/ESP32, r/Arduino, and r/InternetOfThings.
    - *Title Idea*: "I got tired of insecure provisioning, so I built an ECDH+AES library for ESP32. Open Source."
- [ ] **Twitter/X**: Share updates with hashtags #ESP32 #IoT #Embedded #OpenSource.

## 4. Keywords to Target
When writing, always use these exact phrases:
- "ESP32 WiFi Provisioning"
- "Secure BLE Provisioning"
- "ESP32 Bluetooth Config"
- "IoT Network Onboarding"
