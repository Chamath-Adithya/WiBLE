Architecture Aspect,Current (Simple Lib),Advanced (Recommended),Benefits
Code Organization,Single file/class,Multi-module with layers,"Better maintainability, testability, scalability"
State Management,Basic flags/booleans,Finite State Machine (FSM),"Predictable behavior, easier debugging, handles edge cases"
Error Handling,Try-catch blocks,Retry policies + circuit breaker,"Resilient connections, automatic recovery"
Connection Management,Direct BLE calls,Connection pool + queue,"Handle multiple devices, prevent race conditions"
Security,Basic pairing,Multi-layer encryption + OOB,"Production-grade security, protect credentials"
Data Transfer,Single characteristic,Optimized MTU + batching,"Higher throughput, reduced power consumption"
Testing,Manual testing,Unit + integration tests,"Catch bugs early, CI/CD integration"
Platform Support,Single platform,Abstraction layer,Cross-platform reusability
Observability,Print statements,Structured logging + metrics,"Monitor production, debug issues faster"
Configuration,Hardcoded values,Injectable config objects,Flexibility per use case
Documentation,Basic README,API docs + examples,"Faster adoption, fewer support issues"
